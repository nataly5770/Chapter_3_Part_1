        2.14.1 Which of these statements are true?

        a. Any expression can be used as a statement. TRUE
        b. The expression x++ can be used as a statement. TRUE
        c. The statement x = x + 5 is also an expression. YES
        d. The statement x = y = x = 0 is illegal. TRUE it is illegal and makes no sense

        2.14.2 Show the output of the following code:

        int a = 6; (this is done above)
        int b = a++;
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(b);
        a = 6;
        b = ++a;
